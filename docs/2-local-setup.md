# 2. Local Setup

After you have completed the git installation and the account setup, the next step is to clone the repository to your computer. This will create a local copy of the website's code on your computer, which we will then be able to edit and then push to the website that is being hosted. 

First, use your computer's file explorer and then navigate to the folder you wish to save the website's code to. Then, you must open a terminal window in the current directory. On MacOS, right-click on the folder that you wish to open in the terminal and then select Services > New Terminal Tab at Folder. On Windows, press and hold the shift key and right click in the folder, then select "Open PowerShell Window here". On both operating systems, this will open a terminal window at the relevant folder.

Use the following command to clone the repository to the desired folder:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/tellmemuse/tellmemuse.github.io.git
```
This will create a new folder called `tellmemuse.github.io` within the previously selected folder, containing all the code on the GitHub repository.
